# Fuzzy-Logic-Systems-in-Intelligent-Systems-and-Robotics-CE801
 This project consists of two tasks:
 
First task was dedicated in implementing a PID controller on a mobile robot to achieve a right edge following behaviour.

Second task deals with creating fuzzy logic systems for a right edge following behaviour and an obstacle avoidance behaviour separately, which later are combined using subsumption and context blending techniques.
